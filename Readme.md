Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

Git: To clone the repository. Download Git

Node.js and npm: To run the JavaScript code for both frontend and backend. Download Node.js (npm is included).

MongoDB: The database for your application. You can install it locally or use a free cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. Get MongoDB

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project from GitHub. Replace your-github-username/your-repo-name.git with the actual URL of your repository.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git

# Navigate into the newly created project folder
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Set Up and Run the Backend
The backend server needs to be running first so the frontend can communicate with it.

Navigate to the Backend Directory:

Bash

cd src1
Install Dependencies:
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary Node.js modules.

Bash

npm install
Create Environment File:
Create a new file named .env in the src1 directory. This file will store your secret keys and database connection string. Add the following content to it:

Code snippet

# Your MongoDB connection string (replace with your actual string)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aiexam

# A strong, random string for signing tokens
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_that_is_long_and_random
Important: If you're using MongoDB Atlas, get the connection string from your cluster's dashboard.

Start the Backend Server:

Bash

npm start
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in your terminal like:

MongoDB connected ‚úÖ
Server running on port 3003 üöÄ
Leave this terminal window open. The backend is now running and listening for requests.

Step 3: Set Up and Run the Frontend
Now, let's get the user interface running. Open a new terminal window or tab.

Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
From the project's root directory:

Bash

cd src
Install Dependencies:
Just like the backend, the frontend also has its own set of dependencies.

Bash

npm install
Create Environment File:
Create a new file named .env in the src directory. This tells your frontend where to find the backend API.

Code snippet

# The URL where your backend server is running
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3003
Start the Frontend Development Server:

Bash

npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server. Your terminal will show a message similar to this:

  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
  ‚ûú  press h + enter to show help
Step 4: Use the Website
You're all set!

Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Go to the Local URL provided by the frontend server, which is typically http://localhost:5173.

You should now see your AiEXAM website's homepage. You can register new student or teacher accounts, log in, and use all the features of your application locally.
